# Stock Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview

**Objective:** Conduct exploratory data analysis on 12 random stocks, to see if correlation is the same in sectors, and what is a good indication of mean returns, and make recommendations for different investor types. 

**Key Results:**
- Identified 6 distinct investor types using k-means clustering
- Discovered a stock that is a candidate for an options short in NKE

**Skills Demonstrated:** R Programming | Statistical Analysis | K-Means Clustering | Hypothesis Testing | Data Visualization | Investment Strategy

## Business Problem

**Goal:** Conduct exploratory data analysis and translate findings into actionable business insights.

**Audience:**
- Analytics team(me_
- INvestors

**Ask:**
- What stocks perform the best?
- Do sectors move together?
- What strategies can increase returns?
- What stocks are low performers?

**Business Task:** Identify high-value stocks for long-term investment, short-term day trading, and those for options shorting.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed six distinct stock segments:

** Best Bang per Buck: **
- These are low-risk, high-reward, stable stocks with high returns, and are predictable for long-term investment.

** High Performers:** 
- Perform Very Well, ideal also for long-term investments.

** High Risk-Reward:** 
- Prone to drastic rises and falls, might be suitable for day traders and short-term options trading.

** Average Performers:**
- Not much to write home about, decent for portfolio diversity.

** Below Average Performers:** 
- Perform below the 30-day U.S Treasury Bond, not worth the risk, buy bonds instead.

** Disaster-Avoid:**
- Steady losses on average, might be worth shorting as it is in steady decline.
  
## Business Recommendations

- Based on findings, I recommend investing in the Big Best Bang per Buck for long-term investment growth, as well as High Performers.
- Disaster stocks should be considered for options short.
- High Risk-Reward stocks have massive highs and lows, but are otherwise calm. This means you can be both bearish and bullish, if timed right, for high profit margins.
- Average Performers are predictable in their ups and downs, and are a candidate for day traders. 
- Below average performers, I have no recommendation on, but if they offer dividends, it might be worth the investment. Further research is needed
- Disaster stocks are suitable for options shorts. They are on the decline and have been for the past year.

## Technical Approach

**Tools Used:**
- R Studio for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- R Markdown for reproducible reporting

**Analysis Steps:**

**1. Descriptive Statistics**
- Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for all numeric variables
- Analyzed distribution shapes using skewness and kurtosis

**2. Relationship Analysis**
- Correlation analysis between metrics of each stock.
- Sharpe Ratio has the most significant positive correlation with the mean returns. 

**3. Stock Segmentation**
- Standardized all numeric features using z-scores
- Applied k-means clustering (k=4) to identify stock groups

**4. Statistical Validation**
- Chi-square test: X² = 140.24, df = 9, p < 0.001
- Confirms customer segments have significantly different shopping preferences

## Data Source

**Source:** Yahoo Finance via tidyquant library

**Data Quality Assessment (ROCCC):**
- **Reliable:** Direct from trusted Yahoo Finance via API request
- **Original:** Reports by the New York Stock Exchange
- **Comprehensive:** Contains all necessary variables for segmentation analysis
- **Current:** Static dataset (not real-time)
- **Cited:** Well-documented source

**Limitations:**
- The dataset contains 12 stocks
- Data is not dynamic/real-time
- Limited to a point-in-time snapshot

## How to Run This Analysis

**Prerequisites:**
```r
# Install required packages
if(!require("tidyverse"))install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)
if(!require("tidyquant"))install.packages("tidyquant", dependencies = TRUE)
if(!require("e1071"))install.packages("e1071", dependencies = TRUE)
if(!require("corrplot"))install.packages("corrplot", dependencies = TRUE)
if(!require("DT"))install.packages("DT")
```

**Run the analysis:**
```r
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(e1071)
library(corrplot)
library(DT)
# Render the report
rmarkdown::render("index.Rmd")
```

The analysis will generate an HTML report with all visualizations and findings.

## Data Cleaning Process

**Steps taken to ensure data integrity:**
1. Created a backup of the original raw data
2. Checked for and removed null values
3. Verified no duplicate customer records
4. Validated data types for all columns
5. Checked for spelling errors in categorical variables
6. Trimmed extra spaces from text fields

**Documentation:** All cleaning steps are documented in the R Markdown file with inline comments.
